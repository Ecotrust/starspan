java code

starspan.tools:
	ShapeViewer: based on SpearfishSample.java
	ShapeDump: based on org.geotools.demos.data.ShapeReader
	
	Still very simple but working OK:
	
	java -cp _generated/DIST/starspan.jar starspan.tools.ShapeViewer ../../tests/data/vector/starspan_testply
	
	
NOTE: I'm retaking the Java approach in a different project.
