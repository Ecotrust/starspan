Software prerequisites
----------------------
The following libraries must be properly installed on your system
before StarSpan can be compiled and installed:
    * GEOS 2.1.2 or newer
    * GDAL 1.2.6 or newer

For more details about these prerequisites, visit the StarSpan website
at http://starspan.casil.ucdavis.edu/

StarSpan installation
---------------------
A typical installation of StarSpan can be done as follows.

    * Go to http://casil.ucdavis.edu/project/showfiles.php?group_id=48
      and download starspan-XXXX.tar.gz where XXXX is the most
      recent release number.
    * tar zxf starspan-XXXX.tar.gz
    * cd starspan-XXXX
    * ./configure
    * make
    * make install

By default, `make install' will install StarSpan's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/lib', etc. You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'. Depending on the install destination you may
need to have root privileges to run the `make install' step. Type
`./configure --help' for more details.

To run StarSpan, just type `starspan [ARGUMENTS]' at the command prompt.
