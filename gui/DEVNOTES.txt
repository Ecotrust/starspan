StarSpan GUI DEVNOTES

This is an implementation of a GUI for StarSpan based on the GuiE tool.
GuiE provides a graphical user interface to command-line, non-interactive 
programs. Basically, this directory contains the GuiE specification 
starspan.guie required by GuiE, and a mechanism based on Izpack to
create a tailored installer. There are no dependencies on any of the
starspan core system. The only dependency will occur at run time when 
the user executes the command line from within the GUI; at that moment
the GuiE system will call the executable `starspan.'

Prerequisites
	The GuiE jars: guie.jar and nanoxml.jar.
	More info at: http://rtm.casil.ucdavis.edu/
	
	IzPack is used to create the installer.
	http://izforge.com/izpack
	
	Apache Ant is used to compile and build the StarSpan GUI.
	http://ant.apache.org
	
	End users will need a Java Runtime Environment to be able to run
	the StarSpan GUI.

Build
	You may need to adjust some values in build.properties according
	to location of prerequisites in your system.
	
	To create the installer: 
		ant installer
	The executable takes the name install-starspan-gui-${VERSION}.jar
	
	To test the installation:
		ant install
		
Running:
	Run DIR/bin/starspan-gui (unix), or DIR\bin\starspan-gui.bat (windows)
	where DIR is the installation directory. A shortcut is created under
	windows.
	
Status:
	Since GuiE is still experimental... you get the idea.
