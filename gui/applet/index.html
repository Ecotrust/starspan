	  This is a demo of the StarSpan graphical interface, which is
	  currently under development. As an applet, no actual operations
	  can be performed as there are certain restrictions imposed by
	  your Java Runtime Environment (through your browser) that
	  prevent the applet from accessing your file system and running
	  processes on your machine. The applet will give you, however, an
	  excellent way to try and learn more about the operations that
	  StarSpan can perform.
