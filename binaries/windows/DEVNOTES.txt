In this directory we create a binary distribution of StarSpan for Windows.

Build
	- Once you have built the windows binaries, manually copy them
	  in base_dist/bin/. The required files are:
		libgeos_c-1.dll
		libgeos-2.dll
		libgdal-1.dll
		ogrinfo.exe (*)
		gdalinfo.exe
		starspan2.exe

	[(*) Originally created without extension--manually added]

	- Check the values in build.properties according to location of 
	  prerequisites in your system and also the indicate the
      starspan version STARSPAN_VERSION property.
	
	- Create the package with only the command line files: 
		ant cl
	The ZIP takes the name starspan-${STARSPAN_VERSION}-win32.zip
	
	- Create the installer: 
		ant installer
	The executable takes the name install-starspan-win32-${VERSION}.jar
	
		
Running:
	After installation on a Windows machine, either use the file browser
	to run DIR\bin\starspan-gui.bat, where DIR is the installation 
	directory, or launch the shortcut created by the installer.
	
Status:
	Experimental
