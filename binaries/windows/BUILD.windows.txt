	- Windows version with LFS is now successful
	TODO: update this notes accordingly.

	Now attempting under MinGW: MSYS 1.0.10  MinGW 4.1.0
	
	GEOS 2.1.2: I only needed to change source/test/XMLTester.cpp
	so that Polygon is qualified when used. The two lines changed
	now read as follows:
	
	line 49:    //using geos::Polygon; // for mingw ...
	line 454:   vector<geos::Polygon *>*polys = ....
	
	Then, the standard steps:
		./configure
		make          # OK
		make install  # OK
		
		# then, make .dll
		cd /usr/local/lib
		g++ ....  need to recall this command
		# then I got libgeos.dll
		rm libgeos.a libgeos.la  # otherwise gdal build will complain
		                         # about not finding the dynamic libraries
		
	GDAL 1.2.6:
	
		./configure --without-unix-stdio-64 --with-jpeg=no
		make          # library OK, but some apps fail...
		make install  # OK
		
		--without-unix-stdio-64: because MinGW is actually not a supported
		build environment for GDAL
		
		--with-jpeg=no:  my quick fix since I was getting some errors
		related to JPEG support.
		
		
	StarSpan 0.993:
		./configure
		make
		make install
		# OK!
		
		By setting the PATH environment variable according to the location
		of the .dll's and starspan2 binary, StarSpan	can now be executed
		in a Windows Command window.
		
		GUI interface: However, there are some synchronization problems
		in some preliminary tests using the GUI. More tests and adjustments
		are necessary.

	Attempting to build on windows/cygwin again:
	
		GEOS 2.1.1: I only needed to specify 
		extern "C" { #include <ieeefp.h> }
		in geos/platform.h and compilation goes fine.
		
		GDAL 1.2.6: ... problems at linking stage: it cannot
		find some geos::WKT... stuff  :-(
		Then I tried with mingw as indicated in gdal.org.faq.html
		and it compiled fine.
		
		starspan 0.962beta: Compiles but fails with many unresolved 
		link symbols. I guess it's because of the mixing of library
		modes... I'd need to check this again later when I have more
		time.
